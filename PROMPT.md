Create a modern, authoritative webpage using shadcn components that presents "The Future of the Global Tax System" with a focus on participatory budgeting. The design should:
1. Have a clean, professional aesthetic similar to modern government websites
2. Use a structured, systematic layout reminiscent of authoritative academic publications
3. Include appropriate visualizations or icons to represent key concepts
4. Be fully responsive and accessible

The page should have:
- A bold hero section with the title "The Future of the Global Tax System" and subtitle "The Magic Word: Participatory Budgeting"
- A systematic presentation of the taxation concept as humanity's achievement
- A clear explanation of current problems with political waste
- A detailed, numbered breakdown of the participatory budgeting model:
  - Equal distribution of tax allocation power to citizens
  - Citizen-defined projects with precise budgeting
  - Project funding mechanisms and deadlines
  - How this system enhances democratic participation beyond voting

The tone should be visionary yet authoritative, presenting these ideas as a new global standard with rigorous attention to detail. Include a call-to-action section encouraging engagement with this system.

Use shadcn UI components to create a modern interface with beautiful visualizations while maintaining the structured, systematic presentation style of authoritative literature.
